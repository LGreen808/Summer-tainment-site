<p>This summer, I worked as a councelor at Black Bear Lake and it was a good experience. 
Me and the leader of the group-> (group leader) Sarah were in charge of a group of girls who were in the age range of 7-8 years old.
It was definetly a new experience working as a councelor, our group of girls were very nice and it was also fun working with Sarah.
The other councelors there were also very nice and I even became friends with another counselor!. Overall it was a good expeiernce, it felt very cool earning a paycheck and I
also kind of stepped into an adult role this summer, learning that kids can sometimes be a lot.
